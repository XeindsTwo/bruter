          Initially I wrote the software not for sale. Back in 2020, 3 years ago, I used the software myself and some of
          my friends. But since my income has not dropped during this time, and wallets that exist in the world there
          are billions and becomes even more, I decided to earn even more and sell the software, it has absolutely no
          effect on my income from software, but also brings additional profit.

          I can't guarantee that you will find 10 bitcoins or pay off the program in 1 day. BUT I guarantee that if you
          don't find the wallets within a week, I will pay you back!

          As for me, this is one of the most difficult moneys, as I spent a lot of time fixing bugs, writing code, etc.
          over these 3 years. I worked around the clock and spent many sleepless nights at the monitor. For me, this is
          a huge work done!

          Given that most wallets are old forgotten crypto wallets whose owners have most likely forgotten their
          accesses to them, I think legally. I compare it to looking for gold jewelry by the sea-coast, when people with
          a device walk around looking for lost rings, earrings, etc., no one can say it's illegal. I think it is the
          same here!

          All as individual as possible. Sometimes a day absolutely nothing finds, even a few days of silence can be,
          sometimes in a day finds 5-10 wallets at once.
